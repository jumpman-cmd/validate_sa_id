# Validate South African ID

A simple **Java** project built using **Gradle** that performs **validation, extraction**, and **classification** of South African ID numbers using **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles and **JUnit 5**.

## üß™ Project Topic: Unit Testing

This project focuses on the **importance and practicality of unit testing** using JUnit, while solving a real-world problem ‚Äî validating a South African ID number. It demonstrates:
- Writing clean, testable code.
- Developing in small, test-driven increments.
- Understanding test runners and assertions.

## ‚úÖ Features

- **ID Validation**  
  Checks for:
  - Correct length (13 digits)
  - Numeric-only content
  - Valid Luhn checksum

- **Date of Birth Extraction**  
  Extracts birth date in `yyyy-MM-dd` format.

- **Gender Detection**  
  Uses the 7th‚Äì10th digits to determine if the person is *Male* or *Female*.

- **Citizenship Check**  
  Identifies if the holder is a:
  - SA Citizen (`0`)
  - Permanent Resident (`1`)

- **Edge Case Handling**  
  - Null or empty input
  - Invalid dates (e.g. Feb 30)
  - Invalid checksum
  - Non-numeric IDs

## üß™ Sample Unit Tests

All functionality is rigorously tested using JUnit:

- Valid and invalid ID numbers
- Checksum validation
- Gender & citizenship extraction
- Date of birth parsing (with invalid edge cases)

> ‚úÖ **All tests pass successfully.**

## üí° Why Unit Testing?

> *"If you don't write tests, your code is always in a state of uncertainty."*

Unit testing helps:
- Prevent regressions
- Improve focus & productivity
- Promote modular, maintainable code
- Catch bugs early and easily

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up (with Gradle CLI)

This project was bootstrapped manually using the Gradle CLI:

```bash
mkdir validate_sa_id
cd validate_sa_id
gradle init  # Choose 'application' project type when prompted

You can build and test this using:
./gradlew test
